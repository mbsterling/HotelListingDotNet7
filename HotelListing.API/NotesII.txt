To use EF, you need (from NuGet Package Manager)
 - EF for SQL server: "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer"
 - EF Tools: "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools"

 Setting up the migration (steps and models etc.) to create your database
 CODE FIRST.

	- Code first allows for creating your entities/models and then creating your
		tables from your entities/models
	- Set up a valid connection string to your DB
	- Set up your models/entities, in our case Hotels and Countries
	- You add those DbSets to your DbContext file i.e.: 
			DbSet<Hotel> { get; set; }
	- Then you create the tables in your DB by doing a migration using the 
		NuGet Package Manager console tool/window and running the following
		command(s): PM> add-migration InitialMigration
		This will produce a migration file in your project which shows you what
		tables you'll be creating and any PK/FK relationships etc.
	- Finally: PM> update-database.

SEEDING (Putting in default data into the tables we just created)

- You can write the "configurations" (code to seed your table data) directly in
	your DbContext file or you can creat configuration classes keeping with the 
	idea of making sure that a class has one specific task/job and not several

- Once your done "seeding" your data you can run PM> Add-Migration SeedData
	which will create a migration with the details of the seed data that you 
	gave it. and then PM> update-database
	
CONTROLLERS

	- Use: "Add API Controller with actions using Entity Framework"
	- If you have trouble scaffolding double check your version numbers
